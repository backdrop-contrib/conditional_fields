Conditional Fields
======================

Define dependencies between fields based on their states and values. Conditional
Fields is basically a user interface for the States API, plus the ability to
hide fields on certain conditions when viewing content.

The Conditional Fields module allows you to manage sets of dependencies between
fields. When a field is "dependent", it will only be available for editing and
displayed if the state of the "dependee" field matches the right condition.
When editing a node (or any other entity type that supports fields, like users
and categories), the dependent fields are dynamically modified with the States
API.

You can, for example, define a custom â€œArticle teaser" field that is shown only
if a "Has teaser" checkbox is checked.

**Limitations and Known Issues**

- Conditional Fields, for now, supports only core fields and widgets as dependee
fields. Fields from other modules might work, but probably won't. Dependent
fields, though, can be of any type.
